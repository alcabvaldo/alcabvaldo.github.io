# Documentation

This directory contains documentation and implementation plans for the portfolio website.

## Structure

### Plans Directory
Contains implementation and migration plans in chronological order:

1. **`01-productionization-plan.md`** - Original development-focused improvement plan
2. **`02-astro-implementation-plan.md`** - Complete Astro migration plan with SAL.js animations
3. **`03-minimal-astro-migration.md`** - Alternative minimal migration approach

## Implementation History

The portfolio website was successfully migrated from a static HTML5 UP template to a modern Astro-based architecture in 3 phases:

### Phase 1: Minimal Migration
- Migrated static HTML to Astro component structure
- Preserved exact functionality and appearance
- Set up development environment with hot reload

### Phase 2: Enhanced Animations  
- Integrated SAL.js for performant scroll animations
- Added progressive animation timing
- Maintained jQuery compatibility

### Phase 3: Component Architecture
- Created reusable Navigation, Hero, and Contact components
- Centralized data management
- Improved code maintainability and extensibility

## Current Architecture

The site now uses:
- **Astro** - Static site generation with component architecture
- **SAL.js** - Modern scroll animations
- **SCSS** - Preserved original styling system
- **TypeScript** - Type safety and better development experience
