# Progress Log Template (see .specstory/tickets/templates)

## Purpose
Chronologically log actions, decisions, and milestones for a ticket. Complements plan.md (objectives/plan) and context.md (current state) to provide a complete picture of ticket status and history. Supports context switches, traceability, and knowledge transfer.

## Instructions
- Log each significant action, decision, or milestone as a new dated entry (ISO 8601 format).
- Keep entries concise and clear.
- Commit progress at each conversation commit.
- For references, recap, and RCA, update the corresponding separate files (references.md, recap.md, rca.md).
- Reference this template from the ticket-workflow-rule.
